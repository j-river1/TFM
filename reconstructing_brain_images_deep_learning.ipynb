Note : This tutorial will mostly cover the practical implementation of convolutional autoencoders. So, if you are not yet aware about **convolutional neural network (CNN) and autoencoder**, you might want to look at CNN and Autoencoder tutorial. The best part about this tutorial is that you will be loading the 3D volumes as 2D images and will be feeding them in to the model. In a nutshull, you will address the following topics in today's tutorial:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the beginning you will be briefed about Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\n",
        "Then you will understand about the Brain MRI dataset: what kind of images it has, importing the modules, how to read the images, creating an array of the images, preprocessing the brain MRI images to be able to feed them in the model and finally explore the brain MRI images.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the implementation of convolutional autoencoder: you will Fit the preprocessed data into the model, visualize the training and validation loss plot, sabe the trained model and finally predict on the test set.\n",

Tesla is the unit of measuring the quantitative strength of magnetic field of MR images. High field MR scanners (7T, 11.5T) yielding higher SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) even with smaller voxel (a 3-dimensional patch or a grid) size and are thus preferred for more accurate diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "A smaller voxel size leads to a better resolution, which can in turn aid clinical diagnosis. However, the strength of magnetic field being used in MR scanner puts a lower bound on voxel size to maintain a good signal to noise ratio (SNR), in order to preserve the MR image details.\n",
        "Despite the superior image quality of 7T and 11.5T, they are rarely deployed in production due to its cost constraints.\n",

The images are single channel grayscale images. There are in total 30 subjects, each subject containing the MRI scan of a patient. The image format is not jpeg,png etc. but rather nifti format. You will see in later section how to read the nifti format images.\n",

It's good to do the following before initializing Keras to limit Keras backend TensorFlow to use first GPU. If the machine on which you train on has a GPU on 0, make sure to use 0 instead of 1. You can check that by running a simple command on your terminal: for example, nvidia-smi"
